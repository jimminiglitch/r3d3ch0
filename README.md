# Red Echo

This repository contains the static assets for the **Red Echo** interactive narrative.
The site lives in the `docs/` directory so it can be deployed directly with
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Open `docs/index.html` in your browser or enable GitHub Pages for this repository
and point it at the `docs/` folder to see the site online.

A small Fastify server (`app/server.js`) is included for local development. Run
`npm install` inside the `app` directory and then `npm start` to serve the
files locally.
