1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,752
Ayyyy, Brooklyn!

2
00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:01,504
Summer ’97.

3
00:00:01,504 --> 00:00:09,400
A few months back, we lost Biggie Smalls, and the whole city still feels like it’s walking with a limp.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,167
Wu-Tang Forever just dropped though, feels like it's putting back a little pep in our step.

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:20,679
Half the block is rattling windows, Triumph blastin’ from every battered boombox.

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,815
Yeah, it’s a real battle for the Soul out here.

7
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:31,583
Up Manhattan way, Giuliani and his goons are out there “cleaning up” the streets, kicking out the squeegee

8
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:36,847
men, bulldozing the peep shows, putting a fresh coat of beige on Times Square.

9
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:39,479
Their friggin’ grandmotha’s should suck eggs.

10
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,231
So nu.

11
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,112
This is friggin’ Brooklyn, babe.

12
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:47,376
Everybody I know is lining up to see that new  Men in Black  movie.

13
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:51,888
Maybe I call up Charlene, see if she wants to catch it.

14
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:52,264
Nah.

15
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:53,392
Who am I

16
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:53,768
kiddin'?

17
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,776
Charlene don’t wanna see me no more.

18
00:00:56,776 --> 00:01:00,536
I mean, fuhchrisesakes, look at my so-called “life,” eh?

19
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:00,911
Fuhgeddaboudit!

20
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:09,183
No matter how much Febreze I spray, the whole apartment still reeks of off-brand soy sauce, kitty litter, and existential dread.

21
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:09,935
What gives?

22
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:11,815
I don’t even eat

23
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:18,207
Chinese on account of the MSG, and I ain’t owned a cat since Dinkins was mayor.

24
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:22,719
Too bad too, I love the little furballs, but with my allergies?

25
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,727
I’d end up in the friggin’ hospital.

26
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:26,479
Oy vey.

27
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,615
Maybe existential dread is the last, honest aroma left around here.

28
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:44,527
Yeah, my cousin Gina breezes in reekin' of Newports, ranting about how the city’s turning into a giant mall and how the guys down at Nathan’s are swapping out the mustard for some California bullshit.

29
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:50,167
She’s got a fresh blowout and, as always, a mouth that don’t quit.

30
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:54,303
“Mark my words,” she’s kvetching, “You give it five years?

31
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:58,063
Nobody'll even remember what the fuck a  bodega  is.

32
00:01:58,063 --> 00:02:02,575
They’re gonna turn the city into one big-ass Banana Republic.”

33
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:09,343
I nod along, only half listening, flipping through a crumpled Village Voice I found on the Q train.

34
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:18,367
Something about Dolly the Sheep, something about Clinton and some intern, something about how they’re turning Coney Island into a “family-friendly destination?”

35
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,871
Like hell they are.

36
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:24,007
Eh, that’s just great too; so much for the hustle.

37
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:48,071
I mean, sure, there’s always gonna be some market for fake IDs, but its sounding like this Fiorello-wannabe jabroni is makin' a serious dent in my roll, and I doubts Gina keeps risking her exalted position down there at the DMV if all’s I’m racking up on my end ’s a few Friday night delinquents and the occasional paranoid schizophrenic.

38
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:49,575
Gina’s still going.

39
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:58,223
“Betcha they’re puttin’ LSD in the tap water,” she says, pouring herself a cranberry Arbor Mist, the only thing she’ll drink.

40
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:01,607
“That’s how come everyone’s so… so docile.

41
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,111
You ever notice that?

42
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:03,487
Huh?”

43
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:08,751
She takes a long drag, eyes darting to the pigeons on the fire escape.

44
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,255
They coo in unison.

45
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:10,631
Low.

46
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,007
Guttural.

47
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,391
A sound that’s just a little too synchronized.

48
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:17,775
A little too Red Army Chorus for my liking.

49
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:20,407
It’s been happening a lot lately.

50
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:23,791
"You think it's the pigeons that's crazy?

51
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,295
How about them Mets?"

52
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:25,671
Jesus.

53
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,175
I rub my temples.

54
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,055
I gotta get outta here.

55
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:45,975
I slip an MTA token in my pocket (still ain’t used to them MetroCard bullshits), take one last look at the stale pizza on my counter (could probably build low-income housing outta that crust), and I start makin' my way to Coney Island.

56
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,983
Maybe the ocean air will clear my head.

57
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:52,743
Maybe the Cyclone will rattle my brain back into place.

58
00:03:52,743 --> 00:04:03,271
Maybe, just maybe, I’ll win Charlene a plush Tasmanian Devil down at one of the arcades, and she’ll remember why she put up with my ass.

59
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:03,647
Maybe.

60
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:04,399
Probably not.

61
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,527
But either way,

62
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,159
I could use a friggin' Nathans dog.
