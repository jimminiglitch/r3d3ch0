00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,001
Coney Island in the

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:10,002
Summer:

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:15,004
The sand is hot enough to fry a knish, the boardwalk’s creaky as hell, and some guy in a tank top that says "BOSS OF ALL BOSSES" is screaming at

4
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:20,005
a claw machine like it owes him money.

5
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:25,006
There’s a kid crying.

6
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:30,008
There’s always a kid crying.

7
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:35,009
I weave through the boardwalk chaos, past the fortune tellers and the knockoff Oakley vendors, past a guy who’s either selling hot dogs or running a numbers game, or both, maybe. My brain says I should go hit the Cyclone first, ya know, let my bones realign themselves through some high-velocity chiropractic adjustment, but my gut says otherwise.

8
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,010
My gut says

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,012
something’s off.

10
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:50,013
The arcades are mostly the same as they’ve always been. Sticky floors, busted air conditionin', cigarette burns on the cabinets. A small congregation of teenagers hovers around Tekken 3, throwing around some insults that’d make their grandmothers faint silly, but there’s something different here.

11
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:55,014
Something... weird.

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:01:00,016
The Machine

13
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:05,017
It’s in the back corner, where the light don’t hardly reach.

14
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:10,018
Literally, there’s a whole string of half-dead bulbs above it, flickering just enough to make it look like this thing exists in some slightly different dimension.

15
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:15,020
No marquee. No branding.

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,021
Just a plain black cabinet with a glowing start button.

17
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:25,022
I don’t even see nowhere for the quarters to go.

18
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:30,024
Shit, I think this

19
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:35,025
baby is free play!

20
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:40,026
I steps a little closer.

21
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:45,028
The screen flickers and what not…
